# Летний сад (Summer Garden)
## by Anna Akhmatova

- I want to visit the roses
- In that lonely
- Park where the statues remember me young
- And I remember them under the water
- Of the Neva. In the fragrant quiet
- Between the limes of Tsarskoye I hear
- A creak of masts. And the swan swims
- Still, admiring its lovely
- Double. And a hundred thousand steps,
- Friend and enemy, enemy and friend,
- Sleep. Endless is the procession of shades
- Between granite vase and palace door.
- There my white nights
- Whisper of someone’s discreet exalted
- Love. And everything is mother-
- Of-pearl and jasper,
- But the light’s source is a secret.
